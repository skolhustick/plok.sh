### Themes Page
- [] Desktop : 
    [] Make theme, font, and config in first fold, one screen, more compact. 
    [] Maybe the config selector on the left, the config file preview and copy on the right. 
    [] Live preview at the bottom, can toggle desktop and mobile view. 
- [] Mobile : 
    [] A horizontal slider for themes and fonts. 
    [] config preview below that. 
    [] preview only for mobile.
- [] Make top Pick your vibe ✨ text and subtext, more compact, fix wordings.
- [] Font selection button, the name of font, should preview the font itself.
- [] Add all the options for config yaml. make the card less bulky and more compact. focus on the yaml itself.
